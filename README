## GIT tracing: ##
    for tracing repo information Mavanagaiata plugin is used.
    It can generate needed information as java class, that can be used code.
    As example in entry point of application we log current git tag

## To run: ##
    If you use some IDE(IDEA, Eclipse), that provides tools with working with Maven,
    you can import this project using .pom file, and your IDE will generate all needed files

    After maven will download all files, need create  EntryPoint config with specific parameters:
    need run a maven goal git-info before launching application.

    For this in IDEA in "Edit Configuration" window need click to green plus icon near "Before launching ..."
    and choose "Run Maven Goal" and write "git-info", after this steps each time IDEA will generate correct files in target folder that is ignored by git

    to see working project, after starting application go to your link [http:\\localhost:8081](Link URL)
    value of current port can be found application.prgit operties file.
